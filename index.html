            <h2> Vision</h2>
            <p id="vision">Thonny is a simple python IDE for beginners supporting a script editor, a shell, and a terminal. It gives starting programmers a simple platform to practice using the language and learn important computer science topics like language and data structures and algorithms. </p>

            <p id="vision">
                However, in its current version, Thonny does not support live collaboration sessions in which multiple users can read/write the same script simultaneously. Considering the constraints (physical distancing, remote working/learning, …) set by the pandemic, we believe the development of the feature would improve the ease of student collaboration, tutoring, and teaching python-based classes. 
            </p>

            <p id="vision">
                We propose a protocol that supports live collaboration on a file/directory shared by a host. The protocol would be used to develop a Thonny extension/plug-in that enables users to host and join collaboration sessions using the GUI elements enabled by the extension. Changes made during the collaboration session would be saved on the local copy of the host. 
            </p>

            <h2> Design Norms</h2>

            <p id="vision"> <strong>Trust:</strong><br/>Trust plays a bit part in our project. When users are collaborating on work, it is important that what they are working on (Thonny live share) is dependable and reliable. </p>

            <p id="vision"> <strong>Communication:</strong><br/> When using live share, it is important that communication is maintained. When simultaneously editing a document, it is super important that both parties have access to the most up to date page. If there is any lag, this could result in frustration.</p>

            <p id="vision"> <strong>Aesthetics:</strong><br/>It is important to have a visually appealing interface. Visuals rather than functionality is the first thing most people notice. A visually unappealing product often diminishes the benefit of its functionality. </p>
