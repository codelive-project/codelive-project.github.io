            <h2> Vision</h2>
            <p id="vision">Thonny is a simple python IDE for beginners supporting a script editor, a shell, and a terminal. It gives starting programmers a simple platform to practice using the language and learn important computer science topics like language and data structures and algorithms. </p>

            <p id="vision">
                However, in its current version, Thonny does not support live collaboration sessions in which multiple users can read/write the same script simultaneously. Considering the constraints (physical distancing, remote working/learning, …) set by the pandemic, we believe the development of the feature would improve the ease of student collaboration, tutoring, and teaching python-based classes. 
            </p>

            <p id="vision">
                We propose a protocol that supports live collaboration on a file/directory shared by a host. The protocol would be used to develop a Thonny extension/plug-in that enables users to host and join collaboration sessions using the GUI elements enabled by the extension. Changes made during the collaboration session would be saved on the local copy of the host.

                    <p> <strong>Brad Ritzema:</strong><br/> Before and during the pandemic, I have had first-hand experience of the pains of collaboration. Whether this be a group project or pair programming, I am well aware of the problem. On top of this, Thonny’s source code is written in Python, and I have experience in the language. Experience from CS 108 and various personal projects. </p>

                    <p> <strong>Samuel Zeleke:</strong><br/>  I have experience working with python and Thonny. I also have a great interest in the challenges involving shared resources and distributed systems. So, this timely project lets me explore my interest in distributed systems while creating a solution that could help many students </p>

                    <p> <strong>Enoch Mwesigwa:</strong><br/> I have used python and Thonny. I also have some experience with the Tkinter GUI library Thonny was built on. I have also used similar systems in other IDE’s (visual studio and visual studio code), and I’ve seen how useful they are for collaboration and productivity. Such a system would strongly benefit students in intro level classes, and I’m excited to be a part of the team that brings it to them.  </p>
